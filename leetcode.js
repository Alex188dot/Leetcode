58. Length of Last Word 💡

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

*/

function lengthOfLastWord(s) {
  arr = s.trim().split(" ");
  lastWord = arr.pop();
  return lastWord.length;
}

console.log(lengthOfLastWord("   fly me   to   the moon  "));

66. Plus One 💡

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
Example 2:

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
Example 3:

Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].
 

Constraints:

1 <= digits.length <= 100
0 <= digits[i] <= 9
digits does not contain any leading 0's.
*/

var plusOne = function (digits) {
  number = digits.join("");
  let newNum = Number(number);
  if (newNum > 9007199254740991) {
    newNum = BigInt(number) + BigInt(1);
  } else {
    newNum = newNum + 1;
  }
  newArr = String(newNum).split("");
  return newArr;
};

digits = [6, 1, 4, 5, 3, 9, 0, 1, 9, 5, 1, 8, 6, 7, 0, 5, 5, 4, 3];

console.log(plusOne(digits));

1. Two Sum 💡


Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.


*/

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let y = 1; y < nums.length; y++) {
      if (nums[i] + nums[y] == target) {
        if (i == y) {
          continue;
        } else {
          return [i, y];
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List 💡


Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.


Example 1:

Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
